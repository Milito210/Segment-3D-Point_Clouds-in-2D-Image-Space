# Segment-3D-Point_Clouds-in-2D-Image-Space
Projecting 3D point clouds into 2D space for segmentation using traditional CNNs like U-Net. We propose an efficient integer programming method for topology-preserving graph-to-grid mapping, accelerated with a novel hierarchical algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art results on ShapeNet and PartNet.
